All are welcome!

Inspired by the online [Type Theory Study Group 2015](https://github.com/type-theory/type-theory-study-group-2015).


&#42; Programming Languages and Types (yet perfectly understandable) in Sydney &mdash; thanks to Danny Gratzer for the name suggestion.


## When and where

We meet on Monday lunchtimes from 12:30 to 2:00 pm.

Venue is the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, [255 Pitt Street Sydney](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/255+Pitt+St,+Sydney+NSW+2000/@-33.8717056,151.2062129,17z/).

**Please RSVP** via the [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Sydney-Type-Theory/) for catering purposes (and let us know if you have any particular dietary requirements).

## Content

During 2015 and 2016 we read Bob Harper's [Practical Foundations of Programming Languages, 2nd Edition](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/plbook/2nded.pdf).

In 2017 we're reading Simon Thompson's [Type Theory and Functional Programming](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sjt/TTFP/).

## Agenda

For details on what we've covered and what we'll be reading next see the [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Sydney-Type-Theory/)
