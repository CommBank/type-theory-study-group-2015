# Summaries about chapters and topics in PFPL

This is some material produced while reading PFPL chapters, for additional
illustration of ideas during the session, and/or to see alternative ways to
write things down. 

Corrections and extensions are very welcome!

* **languages** ([tex](languages.tex), [pdf](languages.pdf))
  lists syntax, typing rules, and evaluation rules, for a range of languages used in PFPL. 
  New chapters often (but not always)
  extend languages from previous chapters; this summary helps keep an overview.
* **stacks-Ch28** ([tex](stacks-Ch28.tex), [pdf](stacks-Ch28.pdf))
  is a summary of the K machine from chapter 28 and related reasoning.
* **shortcut-example-Ch30** ([tex](shortcut-example-Ch30.tex), [pdf](shortcut-example-Ch30.pdf)) 
  is the example with the shortcut from chapter 30 (continuations).

The Toronto [CompSciCabal](http://cscabal.com) also have a helpful [cheatsheet](https://github.com/CompSciCabal/SMRTYPRTY/blob/master/pfpl/cheatsheet.pdf) summarising notations used in PFPL.
