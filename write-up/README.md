# Summaries about chapters and topics in PFPL

This is some material produced while reading PFPL chapters, for additional
illustration of ideas during the session, and/or to see alternative ways to
write things down. 

Corrections and extensions are very welcome!

* [languages.tex](languages.tex) lists syntax, typing rules, and evaluation
  rules, for a range of languages used in PFPL. New chapters often (but not always)
  extend languages from previous chapters; this summary helps keep an overview.
* [stacks-Ch28.tex](stacks-Ch28.tex) is a summary of the K machine from chapter 28
  and related reasoning.
* [shortcut-example-Ch30.tex](shortcut-example-Ch30.tex) is the example with the
  shortcut from chapter 30 (continuations).
